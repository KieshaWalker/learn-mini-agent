## intents.yml
## ------------
## This file defines the chatbot's knowledge in a simple format:
## - default_response: what to say when no intent matches
## - intents: a list of entries where each has:
##     name: a short identifier (no spaces)
##     patterns: regex patterns that should match user input (case-insensitive)
##     responses: possible replies; one is chosen at random
##
## TIP: When writing regex with backslashes (\), prefer single quotes in YAML.
## For example: use 'good\\s*morning' instead of "good\s*morning".

default_response: "I'm not sure I understand. Could you rephrase?"
